✅ Key Components Explained

Component	Description

SFTP Worker	Connects to external SFTP server, downloads/uploads files, emits message to RabbitMQ.
RabbitMQ	Decouples SFTP I/O from processing logic, ensures reliability and retry handling.
File Processing Service	Reads queue, parses file content, invokes gRPC service for validation.
Business Rules Microservice	Stateless gRPC microservice that applies business rules and validation logic. Uses Protocol Buffers for efficient serialization.
Email Notification Service	Sends emails using SMTP (could be SendGrid, Amazon SES, etc.), templated with discrepancy details.
Database	Stores file metadata, processing logs, discrepancy details, etc.
Telemetry & Monitoring	OpenTelemetry, Serilog/Seq, or Application Insights used across services.
Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)	Captures failed messages after max retries for manual review.



---

🛡️ Best Practices

gRPC + Protobuf: High performance and contract-first APIs between services.

Retry logic with exponential backoff (Polly library).

Dead Letter Queues: For failed RabbitMQ messages after retry limit.

Validation: Before and after file processing (e.g., checksum, size, schema).

Circuit Breaker: Between services to prevent cascading failures.

Structured Logging: With correlation IDs for traceability across services.

Health Checks: Liveness/readiness probes for Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.

Let’s go step by step to define a complete end-to-end architecture and workflow for your .NET 8 microservice system that:

Exchanges files with a third party via SFTP

Uses RabbitMQ for async event-driven architecture

Leverages gRPC with Protocol Buffers between internal microservices

Sends email alerts on discrepancies

Complies with security, encryption, and observability best practices



---

✅ End-to-End Requirements Overview

Category	Requirement

File Handling	Periodically download/upload files from/to SFTP
Message Queue	Decouple components using RabbitMQ
Microservice Communication	Use gRPC with Protobuf for internal service calls
Discrepancy Handling	Detect business rule violations and notify via email
Persistence	Store audit logs, file metadata, validation reports
Security	TLS everywhere, encrypted files at rest, secret management
Observability	Distributed tracing, centralized logging, health checks
Resilience	Retry policies, DLQ, circuit breaker



---

📤 End-to-End Workflow with Message Types

Step 1: File Download from Third-Party SFTP

Service Involved: SftpWorkerService (.NET 8)

Frequency: Every 15 minutes (configurable)

Connection: Secure SFTP over TLS (host key validated)

Action:

Download file (e.g., payment_data_20250619.csv)

Generate hash (SHA-256), validate size

Publish event to RabbitMQ




---

📨 Step 2: Publish Event to RabbitMQ

Exchange: file.events Routing Key: file.received

📦 Message Type: FileReceivedMessage

// file_events.proto
message FileReceivedMessage {
  string file_id = 1;
  string file_name = 2;
  string file_path = 3; // local path or temp location
  string hash = 4;
  int64 size_bytes = 5;
  string sftp_source = 6;
  google.protobuf.Timestamp received_at = 7;
}

Best Practices:

Encrypt message payload at rest (in case of persistent queues)

Include metadata for traceability



---

🔄 Step 3: File Processor Consumes Message

Service: FileProcessorService (.NET 8)

Action:

Read and parse file (e.g., CSV to internal model)

For each row, convert to Protobuf model

Batch and forward to BusinessRulesService over gRPC



---

🧾 Step 4: Send gRPC Request to Business Rules Service

gRPC Service: BusinessRulesService

📦 Request Message: ValidateRecordsRequest

message RecordData {
  string record_id = 1;
  string customer_id = 2;
  double amount = 3;
  string currency = 4;
  google.protobuf.Timestamp transaction_date = 5;
}

message ValidateRecordsRequest {
  string file_id = 1;
  repeated RecordData records = 2;
}

📦 Response Message: ValidationResult

message Discrepancy {
  string record_id = 1;
  string error_code = 2;
  string error_message = 3;
}

message ValidationResult {
  string file_id = 1;
  bool is_valid = 2;
  repeated Discrepancy discrepancies = 3;
}


---

🚨 Step 5: Discrepancy Detection & Email Notification

If ValidationResult.is_valid == false:

Construct email summary

Use EmailNotificationService


📦 Message to Email Notification Queue

message EmailDiscrepancyNotification {
  string file_id = 1;
  string recipient = 2;
  repeated Discrepancy discrepancies = 3;
  string summary_html = 4;
  google.protobuf.Timestamp timestamp = 5;
}

Email sent via SMTP with TLS (or 3rd party like SendGrid)

Includes download link or discrepancy report



---

🗃️ Step 6: Persistence and Audit Logging

DB Tables:

Files: Metadata, hash, size, timestamp, processing status

Records: Parsed rows from file, validation status

Discrepancies: Linked to record_id

AuditLogs: Timestamped events like "file_downloaded", "validated", "email_sent"


Storage:

Use AES-256 encryption on file at rest (e.g., Azure Blob Storage with encryption scope)



---

🔒 Security & Compliance Recap

Layer	Security

SFTP	TLS 1.2+, host key validation, passwordless key auth
RabbitMQ	TLS with cert auth, encrypted queues
gRPC	mTLS between internal services, JWT-based RBAC
SMTP	STARTTLS or HTTPS if using provider
Secrets	Azure Key Vault or AWS Secrets Manager
Data at Rest	AES-256 encrypted files and DB
Audit Trails	Logged to central store, protected from tampering
Logs/Telemetry	Serilog → Seq/ELK; Traces via OpenTelemetry
Health Probes	Liveness, readiness, metrics endpoints for all services
Retry Policies	With Polly, DLQ fallback on RabbitMQ



---

📈 Example Flow Summary (Narrative)

1. SftpWorkerService downloads payment_data_20250619.csv from SFTP.


2. It verifies hash/size, then publishes a FileReceivedMessage to RabbitMQ.


3. FileProcessorService reads the file, parses it, and sends records to BusinessRulesService via gRPC.


4. Business rules identify 5 discrepancies related to currency mismatches and missing transaction dates.


5. A formatted email with the discrepancy report is queued and sent by EmailNotificationService.


6. File metadata, audit logs, and errors are persisted securely in the database.


7. Telemetry and logs are pushed to a centralized store, accessible to ops and auditors.

Great catch! Let's include the reverse communication flow:

> 🔁 Third-party sends an issue/discrepancy notification over email regarding a previously sent or received file.


🧩 Scenario: Third-Party Sends Issue Notification via Email

🔄 Updated Flow Summary

1. Third-party receives file over SFTP.


2. They detect an issue (e.g., incorrect schema, invalid record).


3. They send an email to your system's monitored inbox (e.g., issues@yourcompany.com).


4. Your system automatically:

Parses the email

Extracts metadata (e.g., file name, error message)

Logs it

Links it to existing processing logs

Triggers internal alerts or creates a ticket





---

✉️ Step-by-Step Implementation

🟦 1. Monitored Mailbox Processor (.NET 8)

Runs periodically or via IMAP IDLE (push)

Connects to monitored mailbox over IMAP with STARTTLS/TLS

Uses libraries like:

MailKit

.NET System.Net.Mail (fallback)



Behavior:

Searches for new emails with subject like Issue: File [file_name]

Parses:

File name

Error summary

Timestamp

Sender domain (for validation)


Converts to internal message format



---

📦 New Message Type: ThirdPartyIssueReportedMessage

message ThirdPartyIssueReportedMessage {
  string file_id = 1;
  string file_name = 2;
  string issue_description = 3;
  string reported_by = 4;
  google.protobuf.Timestamp reported_at = 5;
  string raw_email_body = 6;
}


---

🔁 Internal Routing:

Publish to: file.issues.reported RabbitMQ topic

Consumed by:

FileIssueProcessorService

Optional: IncidentManagementService (create ticket or Slack alert)




---

🟨 2. Log + Notify

Link to existing file metadata in DB (via file_name)

Update file status to Issue Reported

Save full email in audit table

Optional:

Send confirmation to internal ops (via email/Teams/Slack)

Trigger retry/reprocessing (manual or automated)




---

🛡️ Security/Compliance Considerations

Concern	Solution

Email spoofing	Validate domain (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), check known senders
Email injection	Sanitize inputs before displaying/logging
Confidential data	Store email content encrypted
Alert fatigue	Throttle alerts, deduplicate similar issue reports
